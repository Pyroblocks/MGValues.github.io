    <h2>What is MGValues?</h2>
        <p>MGValues is a political compass test that is based on the <a href="https://discord.gg/6eZGuw5QVF">PA-EP Mock Government</a>. It is a fork of the <a href="https://github.com/SapplyValues/SapplyValues.github.io">SapplyValues Github repository</a>. You will be presented by a statement, and then you will answer with your opinion on the statement, from <b>Strongly Agree</b> to <b>Strongly Disagree</b>, with each answer slightly affecting your scores. At the end of the quiz, your answers will be displayed on a political compass.<br /><br />
        There are <b><u><span id="numOfQuestions"></span></u></b> questions in the test.</p>
    <h2>Will my results be publically desplayed?</h2>
    <p>If you are a member of the Mock Government, feel free to DM Pyro#1716 to share your score. It will be added to a universal compass that can be seen in the official <a href="https://discord.com/channels/752775316803551344/812085730553364540">Board of Information channel</a>.
	    The Board of Information may reach out to you if you are a prominent member of the Mock Government to ask for your score. If you want your score to be removed, please DM Pyro#1716.</p>
    <h2>Your questions / results suck!</h2>
    <p>The Board of Information is in charge of the creation of this test. Please contact Pyro#1716 if you have a complaint, question, or suggestion.</p>
    <h2>What are the axes?</h2>
    <p>The up/down axis is Federalist/Unitarian, the institutional views of Technoists and Alianzens, respectively. Federalists support group rights over individual rights, compared to Alianzens who support individual rights over group rights.
	The sliding scale on the right side is Modernist/Forwardist. Forwardists support a lot of change, especially in the short-term, while modernists favor less change in the long-term.
	The left/right axis is Technoist/Alianzen, the economic views of Technoists and Alianzens, respectively. Technoists support instating and utilizing economic institutions to better the economy, while Alianzens prefer to improve the economy without the use of institutions, and are staunchly opposed to taxes.</p>
